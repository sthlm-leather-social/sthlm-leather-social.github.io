Leather is a style and culture that developed in the gay bars and
motorcycle clubs of the 1950s and 1960s. There are as many
definitions of Leather as there are Leatherpeople. Leather is a
style, an identity, a community, and a subculture that celebrates
kink, fetish, BDSM, and sex.

What is gear?
Gear is the body of all of our Leather cultural expression, including
leather, rubber, and puppy/pet play outfits and accessories. Gear can
be part of play but many people enjoy wearing gear for social reasons
and don&rsquo;t consider their gear to be at all sexual." />

<blockquote>
<p>Leather is a style and culture that developed in the gay bars and
motorcycle clubs of the 1950s and 1960s. There are as many

<p><em>What is gear?</em></p>
<p>Gear is the body of all of our Leather cultural expression, including
leather, rubber, and puppy/pet play outfits and accessories. Gear can
be part of play but many people enjoy wearing gear for social reasons
and don&rsquo;t consider their gear to be at all sexual.</p>
<p><em>What is dress code?</em></p>
<p>Some Leather events maintain a dress code to make sure only those with
a genuine interest partake. Dress codes can either be formalized or
left to the discretion of the doorman. While we encourage gearing up
the Stockholm Leather Social does not have a dress code.</p>
<p><em>What is bootblacking?</em></p>
<p>Bootblacking is the practice of caring for and shining leather
gear. While always a service to the community, bootblacking is not
always part of play. Despite often being sensual, bootblacking is not
necessarily erotic or submissive. Tipping is encouraged but not always
necessary.</p>

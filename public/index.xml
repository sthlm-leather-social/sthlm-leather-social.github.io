      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stockholm Leather Social is an initiative to bring Leather subculture into the streets. We further the rich Leather history of our city by facilitating safe and approachable spaces to foster local community in a public setting. In doing so we promote queer visibility in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We encourage gearing up for our events, but realize that not everybody is in the same place in their Leather journey. No matter your gear or how you identify, you are welcome at Stockholm Leather Social. We are unapologetically queer and kink-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is Leather?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leather is a style and culture that developed in the gay bars and&#xA;motorcycle clubs of the 1950s and 1960s. There are as many&#xA;definitions of Leather as there are Leatherpeople. Leather is a&#xA;style, an identity, a community, and a subculture that celebrates&#xA;kink, fetish, BDSM, and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://leatherarchives.libguides.com/whatisleather/&#34;&gt;Leather Archives &amp;amp; Museum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is gear?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gear is the body of all of our Leather cultural expression, including&#xA;leather, rubber, and puppy/pet play outfits and accessories. Gear can&#xA;be part of play but many people enjoy wearing gear for social reasons&#xA;and don&amp;rsquo;t consider their gear to be at all sexual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Leather is a style and culture that developed in the gay bars and
motorcycle clubs of the 1950s and 1960s. There are as many
definitions of Leather as there are Leatherpeople. Leather is a
style, an identity, a community, and a subculture that celebrates
kink, fetish, BDSM, and sex.</p>

<p><em>What is gear?</em></p>
<p>Gear is the body of all of our Leather cultural expression, including
leather, rubber, and puppy/pet play outfits and accessories. Gear can
be part of play but many people enjoy wearing gear for social reasons
and don&rsquo;t consider their gear to be at all sexual.</p>
<p><em>What is dress code?</em></p>
<p>Some Leather events maintain a dress code to make sure only those with
a genuine interest partake. Dress codes can either be formalized or
left to the discretion of the doorman. While we encourage gearing up
the Stockholm Leather Social does not have a dress code.</p>
<p><em>What is bootblacking?</em></p>
<p>Bootblacking is the practice of caring for and shining leather
gear. While always a service to the community, bootblacking is not
always part of play. Despite often being sensual, bootblacking is not
necessarily erotic or submissive. Tipping is encouraged but not always
necessary.</p>

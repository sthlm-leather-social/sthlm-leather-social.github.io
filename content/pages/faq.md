## What is gear?

Gear is the body of all of our Leather cultural expression, including
leather, rubber, and puppy/pet play outfits and accessories. Gear can
be part of play but many people enjoy wearing gear for social reasons
and don't consider their gear to be at all sexual.

## What is dress code?

Some Leather events maintain a dress code to make sure only those with
a genuine interest partake. Dress codes can either be formalized or
left to the discretion of the doorman. While we encourage gearing up
the Stockholm Leather Social does not have a dress code.

## What is bootblacking?

Bootblacking is the practice of caring for and shining leather
gear. While always a service to the community, bootblacking is not
always part of play. Despite often being sensual, bootblacking is not
necessarily erotic or submissive. Tipping is encouraged but not always
necessary.
